Here’s an explanation of the **Assignment 01: Python Setup and Basic Print Statements**:

### Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to ensure that:
- Python and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) are installed correctly on your laptop.
- You practice verifying your Python installation and writing basic Python print statements.

### Tasks Breakdown:

#### 1. **Install Python:**
   - Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - This will allow you to run Python scripts and use Python packages.

#### 2. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
   - Download and install VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - VS Code is a code editor that you will use to write your Python scripts and run them.

#### 3. **Verify Python Installation:**
   - Open your terminal or command line (Command Prompt on Windows or terminal on macOS/Linux).
   - Run the following command to check if Python is installed correctly:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - This should show the version of Python installed (e.g., `Python 3.x.x`).

#### 4. **Set Up a GitHub Account:**
   - If you don’t already have a GitHub account, create one at [github.com](https://github.com/).
   - GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration where you will upload your work (such as scripts) and track changes over time.
   - Take a screenshot of your GitHub profile to show you have created one.

#### 5. **Run Basic Print Statements in Python:**
   - Write a Python script to print the following details about yourself:
     - Your name
     - Your father’s name
     - Your current status (e.g., student or professional)
     - If you're a student, your field of study; if you're a professional, your job title.
     - Your age
     - Your city
   - Here’s an example Python script you can write:
     ```python
     print("Your Name: John Doe")
     print("Father's Name: Muhammad Tayyab")
     print("Current Status: Student")
     print("Field of Study: Computer Science")
     print("Age: 22")
     print("City: Karachi")
     ```
   - Run this script locally or in Google Colab to see the output.

#### 6. **Take Screenshots:**
   - You need to take screenshots of:
     1. The Python installation process.
     2. The VS Code installation process.
     3. The output of the `python --version` command (to verify Python installation).
     4. Your GitHub profile page.
     5. The output of the Python script you wrote with the print statements.

#### 7. **Submission:**
   - Upload the screenshots to **Google Classroom**.
   - If you ran the Python script in Google Colab, provide the Google Colab link. Otherwise, upload a screenshot of the print statement output.
   - You’ll also need to provide your **PIAIC roll number** in the comments section when submitting the assignment.

### Steps for Submission:
- Install Python and VS Code.
- Verify your Python installation using the terminal.
- Write and run the Python script with print statements.
- Set up a GitHub profile and take a screenshot of it.
- Upload all screenshots and submit your Google Colab link or script output.

This assignment ensures that you’re able to set up the necessary tools and perform some basic operations in Python. Let me know if you need further clarification!
